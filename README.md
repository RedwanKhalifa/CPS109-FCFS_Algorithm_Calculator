The objective of this program is to produce the results of a simple CPU scheduling algorithm called FCFS (First Come First Serve). 
The user will input the name of their process along with their respective arrival time and burst time in a file. The program will 
then return the values for the turn around time and waiting time with averages for each process in the console.
